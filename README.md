## Project Description

This project focuses on classifying images into various categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. After training, the model is converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format for deployment on mobile and embedded devices. The notebook also includes code for making predictions on new images.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment and Activate It**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Notebook Overview

### Importing Libraries

The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and various utilities for image processing and model building. This includes modules for loading data, defining the model architecture, and performing data augmentation.

### Data Preprocessing

Paths to the training and validation datasets are defined. The `ImageDataGenerator` class is used to perform data augmentation on the training dataset, which helps improve the model's generalization by randomly transforming the images during training. The validation data is only rescaled.

### Building the Model

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is constructed using Keras' Sequential API. The model consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, which are used to extract features from the images. After the convolutional layers, the data is flattened and passed through fully connected (dense) layers for classification. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function to output a probability score for binary classification.

### Training the Model

The model is compiled with a loss function suitable for binary classification, an optimizer, and metrics to monitor performance. The training process involves fitting the model to the training data and validating it on the validation data. The model's weights are saved to an `.h5` file after training.

### Model Conversion

The trained Keras model is converted to TensorFlow Lite format using the TensorFlow Lite Converter. The TFLite model is saved to a file for deployment on mobile and embedded devices. Additionally, the model is saved in `.h5` format to ensure compatibility and for future use.

### Making Predictions

The notebook includes code for loading the saved model and making predictions on new images. A helper function preprocesses the images to match the input shape expected by the model. The model predicts the class of the image, and the result is displayed along with the confidence level. Class labels are retrieved from a text file.
